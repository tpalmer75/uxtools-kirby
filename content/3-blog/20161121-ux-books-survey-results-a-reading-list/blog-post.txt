A few months ago I sent a survey about design books around DesignerNews, Reddit, and the [PDA](http://www.productdesignutah.org/) Slack channel. I was seeking to understand what designers were interested in reading and what their top UX books were. It drew 87 survey responses and revealed some interesting insights into the world of UX reading. I used it as a springboard to create what is now [The UX Library](http://uxtools.co/library).

Granted, this data is _super_ biased (Designers who browse the same sites I do and are willing to fill out a survey) but it’s something. One possible takeaway is that designers earlier in their career are more interesting in learning from UX books, and thus were more likely to take the survey. You decide!

### Insight #1: Mostly Beginners

Of the 87 respondents, most were in the first five years of their career. I fall into this same category, so I was intrigued to learn what my peers were reading.

### Insight #2: Beginners Want Advanced Reading

Though over 50% of respondents were early in their career, very few were interested in beginner-related material. My assumption is that these younger designers are interested in sharpening their skills and moving up the food chain. I know I am.

### Insight #3: UX Designers ❤️ Usability

Obviously, respondents were most interested in classical UX fields: usability, research, and psychology. However (to my surprise), the lowest areas of interest were data and development. Inexperience, or disinterest?
