Description: The easiest ways to design in Sketch and prototyping in Framer.

----

Text:

Most prototyping apps import from Sketch, as Framer has done for a long time. As this integration grows deeper, more options have become available. Framer now has several ways to import design. There‚Äôs no right way!

### 1. Copy/Paste into Framer¬†Design

This week Framer released ‚ÄúFramer Design‚Äù, which is UI editor inside of Framer. It‚Äôs similar to Sketch with the the ability to artboards, shapes, and more. Don‚Äôt expect to pull your Sketch layers right inside, though. It‚Äôs not quite there yet.

### Output format

Images. Using this method, you can copy the necessary layers from your Sketch file and place them into a Framer artboard.

### Pros

Speed and simplicity.

### Cons

Pasted as images. Copying from Sketch essentially flattens your selection into a rasterized PNG, meaning those layers don‚Äôt scale well and can become pixelated. This method will prevent you from manipulating text, shape color, and other properties‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääso you might have to mix and match as you pull from Sketch and create new layers in Framer.

Also, the pasted images don‚Äôt maintain any sort of naming convention. Only the layer name ‚Äúimage.‚Äù

### Notes

Designing at 1x, but prototyping in 2x? No worries! Just use the Sketch scale function (cmd+K).

### 2. Use the [Copy-Framer-Code](https://github.com/perrysmotors/copy-framer-code) Plugin

Thanks to [Giles Perry](https://twitter.com/Giles_Perry) for his awesome plugin to copy Framer Code straight from Sketch. The principle is simple: select shapes in Sketch, use the plugin, and paste it as code right into Framer!

### Output format

Framer Layers. Doesn‚Äôt get much better than that.

### Pros

Native layers are instantly available to use and manipulate, including editable text.

### Cons

Pasted layers don‚Äôt use proper Framer alignment functions (Align.center, etc) and use strict X, Y, and width. It‚Äôs not a big deal, but you might find yourself wanting those features.

### Notes

I highly recommend this method, as you can continue to manipulate the shapes and text in Framer (but not yet in Framer Design üòû). Be sure to check out his tutorial for [copying and pasting images and icons](https://github.com/perrysmotors/copy-framer-code) (bottom of the page) from Sketch into Framer as well.

### 3. Framer¬†Import

This is the standard Framer import that has existed for a while now. It‚Äôs extremely easy to use, and very simple.

### Output format

Images.

### Pros

Framer‚Äôs Sketch imported can be repeated as many times as necessary, always writing over the original import. This makes it easy to tweak the design and reimport without having to fundamentally alter your project or start over.

### Cons

This method suffers from any other image issues: No resizing, no scaling, no editable text.

### Notes

This is still the bread-and-butter of rapid prototyping, but not a great long-term solution. I expect Framer Design to catapult the product into a whole new level of Sketch integration.

***

So there you have it. No more excuses preventing you from using Framer and Sketch together! You have plenty of options. (Though if you‚Äôre on the Framer team and reading this, please create an integration to copy into real Framer Design shapes üôè).
