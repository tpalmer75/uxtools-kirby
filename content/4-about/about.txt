# Hi, I'm [Taylor](https://twitter.com/_taylorpalmer).

I’m a senior UX designer based out of Utah, currently working at [Lucid](https://golucid.co). I maintain uxtools.co in my free time, and I support my costs on ads. I try to only put one or two ads on each page, so hopefully you'll find it within your heart to turn off your ad blocker ❤️. 

Looking to get in touch?
